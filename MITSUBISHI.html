<p>
the Pajero Sport is not to be confused with the unrelated Pajero, despite both being rugged, ladder-frame 4x4s.

The Pajero is Mitsubishi’s ageing off-road icon – it won the Dakar Rally 12 times if you don’t mind – but the current model has some underpinnings dating back to 1999 and it’s likely to be phased out in the next couple of years. 

The Pajero Sport, however, arrived in 2015 as a replacement for the forgettable Challenger. Fast forward a few years and Mitsubishi has given the Pajero Sport a nip and tuck, with new safety and comfort gear, a refreshed interior and styling tweaks.</p>

<div class="Eclipse">

<p>
The 2020 Eclipse Cross looks like few other compact crossovers and reminds everyone that Mitsubishi makes more than appliances. Along with decent interior quality and surprising practicality, the Eclipse Cross is the company's most polished product. Its turbocharged engine has enough juice to motivate the funky Mitsubishi around town and its automatic transmission is unusually quiet while cruising. However, its powertrain feels feeble at highway speeds and its sporty design doesn't translate to driving dynamics. Still, the Eclipse Cross has a compliant ride, useful cargo storage, and can be outfitted with the latest technology features.

<p>
The Mitsubishi Triton ute has had a minor makeover for the 2020 model year, but the changes will appeal mostly to those who want to head off-road.

Mitsubishi has added a rear diff lock to the middle-of-the-range GLX+ and GLS, both of which are popular variants among private buyers. Previously a rear diff lock – standard on most ute rivals but absent on the Holden Colorado and Isuzu D-Max – was only available on the flagship Mitsubishi Triton GLS Premium.

Mitsubishi has also added the air-recirculating roof pod (to redirect cool air to back seat passengers) to the GLX+ – previously it was only on the GLS and GLS Premium.

The GLX+ does still, however, miss out on Mitsubishi’s Super Select system, which allows the Triton to be operated in four-wheel drive on sealed roads. For now, only the GLS and GLS Premium retain this class-exclusive feature of having a switchable four-wheel-drive system that can be operated on sealed roads. All Triton 4x4 models can, however, still engage four-wheel drive while on the move up to 100km/h.</p>
