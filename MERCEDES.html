<p >The second generation of the Mercedes-Benz GLA attempts to ride on the success of its predecessor with an all-new design language and various improvements that transform the compact crossover into a more SUV-like model. Based on the MFA2 (Modular Front-wheel-drive Architecture) platform, which is shared with seven other compact Mercedes-Benz models, the new GLA has a brand new character. Higher than its predecessor by more than 10 centimeters, the new model offers increased headroom and even more legroom, despite being actually shorter than the model it replaces.

    Also as a novelty, the models fitted with all-wheel-drive 4Matic now feature the so-called Off-Road Engineering Package as standard, which consists of an additional driving program, a downhill driving assist system and a special light function on the optional Multibeam LED headlights. The engine lineup comprises a host of new or improved four-cylinder engines on both gasoline and diesel flavor, sending their power to the front or both axles via a six-speed manual transmission or a 7- and 8-speed dual-clutch transmission, depending on engine choice and trim level. Just like its other compact brothers, the second-generation GLA comes fitted as standard with the award-winning MBUX infotainment system, which can also be accessed via the central touchscreen.</p>

<p>The fifth generation of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class was unveiled in 2016 at the North American International Auto Show. It was a clear departure from the previous design language.

    In the mid-'90s, Mercedes-Benz switched from a mono-bloc headlights design to a dual headlamp, which could be seen on the E-Class and it was used until 2016 with the launch of the fifth generation of the mid-size sedan of the German brand.
    
    The front end underlined the business-class sedan status of the car. It boasted a different look for each design and equipment line. The base model featured the classic Mercedes-Benz grille with the star on the hood, as the Exclusive line. The Avantgarde and AMG Line models were identifiable by sports grille with a large badge in the middle. The broad shoulders over the rear wheel arches amplified the image of the car and, in the rear, the single-piece taillights featured a two-bar design.
    
    Inside, the 2016 E-Class offered as an option two high-resolution displays, each with a wide diagonal of 12.3”, a first in that segment. Beneath the shared class cover, the two displays appeared as a widescreen, forming a single horizontal long display with the instrument cluster and the infotainment system. In addition, touch-sensitive control buttons ('Touch Controls') on the steering wheel made their first appearance in a car. Like a smartphone interface, they responded to horizontal and vertical swiping movements, allowing the driver to control the entire infotainment system using finger swipes without having to take their hands off the steering wheel.
    
    The 2016 Mercedes-Benz E-Class was launched with a choice of two engines: the E 200 with a four-cylinder gasoline unit and the E 220 d with an all-new four-cylinder diesel.</p>

    <p>Mercedes-Benz board of directors decided that they wants a big piece of the SUV-Coupé market and launched the GLC Coupé. Now they came with a facelift which will add more performance, more economy and technology to the smallest SUV-Coupe from the three-pointed star brand. 

        They came with both gasoline and diesel and in four cylinders architecture with Euro6d. In order to achieve this, they will use both catalytic converters and a SCR system with AdBlue for the diesels and gas particulate filters for the gasoline powertrains. Gas engines will have a 48 volts architecture and the alternator also plays the starter role. The system acts like micro-hybrid technology, diminishing the fuel consumption and also adding more comfort to the driving experience. 
        
        The drivetrain will host a choice of suspensions both mechanical or pneumatically controlled. Transmission choices are either a 6-speed manual or a 9-speed automatic transmission. 
        
        On the outside, the fastback-like look will be enhanced by the LED lights standard on the rear and as an option on different versions for the newly designed headlights. 
        
        Inside, you can find room up to five people, but the cramped rear seats are made more like for four people. Being a Mercedes-Benz means that the technology must be present in every detail. The refreshed GLC Coupé will offer a combination of touchscreen display, navigation and augmented reality to help users to have a better experience.</p>

<p>Initially introduced as niche model with not exactly great chances of becoming a sales hit in the compact Mercedes-Benz lineup, the CLA has managed to prove otherwise. Over 750,000 CLA Coupes and CLa Shooting Brakes have been sold from the first generation, prompting Mercedes-Benz to invest in the development of a modern reiteration. 

    Based on the MFA2 platform, the all-new CLA II is a tad longer, wider, has a much longer wheelbase but is also slightly lower than its predecessor, making for an even more dramatic look. The aggressive but elegant looks is somewhat contradicting the overall design, which is a lot smoother and more polished, without making so much use of complex lines and non-aerodynamic intakes. The interior is pretty much a carbon copy of the one found in the A-Class W177, which was no surprise considering the two share the same platform. Also expected was the introduction of MBUX on the new CLA, which takes Mercedes-Benz infotainments to new heights through Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mercedes-Benz G-Class was not a new generation for the famous off-road vehicle. It was a completely new book that changed the whole concept of the vehicle.

    For almost four decades, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class (or G-Wagon) was the same rugged vehicle, with a ladder-chassis and solid axles front and rear. Over the years, some of its characteristics were improved. The basic, cloth, the interior was changed to exclusive leather. The 4-speed manual was upgraded up to a 7-speed automatic with dual-clutch and the four-banger with a carburetor was replaced to state-of-the-art V8 with direct injection and twin-turbo. But the ladder-chassis was the same. The solid axles were still in place and the three lockable differentials were installed as well. 
    
    In January 2018 the new G-Class was shown at the North-American International Auto Show in Detroit. The new G-Class was 121 mm (4.8") wider, 53 mm (2") longer and 39 mm (1.5") taller. The increase in the ground clearance was a mere 6 mm (0.23"). But there was a new ladder-type frame and a double-wishbone suspension on the front. The rear axle was kept, but with a different type of connection to the chassis. The three lockable differentials were kept and the low-gear transfer box as well. 
    
    And so, the 2018 G-Class succeeded to bring more comfort and still the same off-road abilities as the older version. At the time of launch, there were three engines available: two gasoline units and a brand new inline-six turbodiesel. These were mated to a 9-speed Speedhift MCT transmission.</p>

    <p>After testing the waters with the B-Class Electric Drive and various electric versions of the smart fortwo and smart forfour, Mercedes-Benz has finally unveiled its first production EV, the EQC. Also the first model to be produced under the Mercedes-EQ sub-brand, the EQC is an electric-only crossover that's partly based on the MRA (Modular Rear-wheel-drive Architecture) platform. Similar in size with the GLC, the model is powered by two electric motors, one for each axle, giving it a total output of 300 kW (408 PS, or 402 HP) and a tire-scorching 765 Nm (564.2 lb-ft) of torque. 

        Since each motor powers an axle, the EQC comes as standard with torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive, while an 80 kWh lithium-ion battery designed and built in-house will apparently gift the car with a provisional range of "more than 450 km (280 miles) according to NEDC. The onboard charger (OBC) is water-cooled and has a capacity of 7.4 kW, while Mercedes-Benz says that the vehicle can be charged with a maximum output of 110 kW at an appropriate charging station. The first version's full name is actually the Mercedes-Benz EQC 400, which pretty much means that we will see more than one output and total range from the EQC in the future.</p>
