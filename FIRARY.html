    <p>The 2020 Ferrari 812 Superfast is an example of what happens when an automaker commits to crafting a vehicle that offers the best performance money can buy. With almost 800 horses under the hood, this coupe provides brutish power, facilitating a zero-to-60-mph sprint that clocks in at less than three seconds. There's also a certain practicality at play, since the 812 Superfast offers more cargo space than the typical supercar—enough to make it a reasonably accommodating choice for daily commutes. Fuel economy is poor, and the 812 Superfast's $330,000-plus price makes it accessible only to the very privileged few. Still, if you have deep pockets and a thirst for spectacular handling, this skilled Ferrari won't disappoint.</p>

    <p>This white-and-blue-striped model made its debut at the decadent Monterey Car Week festivities, where a 1962 Ferrari 250GTO sold for $48.4 million. For a mere 1 percent of the price of that old racing car—which may not see sunlight again until its owner decides to sell—you could enjoy the best power-to-weight ratio of any Ferrari convertible (barring the LaFerrari Aperta) without fearing a smidge of new-car depreciation. Ferrari claims this car's 4.3 pounds per pony won't hinder its ability to clock an estimated 2.8-second run from zero to 60 mph, although the power-folding hardtop helps add roughly 220 pounds (per Ferrari's quoted dry weight, without fluids) over the weight of the Pista coupe. The extra weight, by its maker's estimation, slows the Pista's run to 124 mph (needing 8.0 seconds instead of the coupe's 7.6) but not its 211-mph top speed.</p>

  <p>Lithe and voluptuous, the 2020 Ferrari F8 Tributo is the supercar to choose if you like your automotive performance packaged in an undeniably glamorous wrapper—and who doesn't? With its chiseled panels and windblown profile, the F8 Tributo looks more beautiful than brash, which sets it apart from other cars in Ferrari's stable. This coupe is new to the Ferrari lineup for the 2020 model year, stepping in to replace the outgoing 488GTB. Memorably quick off the line, the F8 Tributo is motivated by the same burly 710-hp V-8 that lives under the hood of the 488 Pista. This alluring coupe costs more than an Ivy League education, but its price is justified by its winning style and breathtaking performance.</p>

<p>Supercars such as the 720S have the performance of a Formula 1 race car and the body of a fighter jet. Its innate ability to combine both characteristics are what make this McLaren so fantastic. Dihedral doors and a skull-like expression converge on its convex bodywork, which hides an insanely powerful 710-hp twin-turbo V-8 powertrain. But this mid-engined exotic—available as a slippery coupe or an exposed convertible—is more than a straight-line speedster. Both body styles deliver world-class steering feedback, surprising ride dexterity, and relentless stopping power. Along with innumerable custom options, the 2020 720S epitomizes the special relationship between car and driver.</p>

<p>The DBS Superleggera combines the best of the modern Aston Martins with a historic name presented in a stunning package. While the DBS shares a design with the all-aluminum DB11, carbon fiber adorns much of the body. Lucky buyers can choose from the coupe or the Volante convertible, which offers the same top speed but looks the business with its soft top folded.
