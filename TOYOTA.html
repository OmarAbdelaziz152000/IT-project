<p>
The Camry is a great midsize car that hits all the marks. It boasts nimble handling, a comfortable ride, two strong engine choices, an upscale interior, and a user-friendly infotainment system. For its mix of quality and value, we named the Camry our 2020 Best Midsize Car for the Money. The Camry also took home our 2020 Best Midsize Car for Families award because of its superior combination of cargo and passenger space, safety and reliability ratings, positive reviews from automotive journalists, and available family-friendly features.

<p>
the Corolla is a good compact car. It earns great fuel economy estimates and has a terrific predicted reliability rating. It also has lots of standard driver assistance features and an easy-to-use infotainment system. It does have some notable drawbacks, however. This Toyota doesn't deliver the engaging driving experience that many classmates offer, and the base engine is uninspiring. Also, the Corolla doesn't have the passenger and cargo space of some rivals.

<div class="mirai">
<img class="mirai" src="mirai.jpg" alt="toyota mirai" width="100%" >
<p>
The 2020 Toyota Mirai is an electric vehicle that creates its own electricity using hydrogen, oxygen, and a fuel cell, and its only tailpipe emission is water vapor. The Mirai is powered by hydrogen, and refueling takes just five minutes. This mid-size sedan has a driving range of more than 300 miles, and it delivers quiet, comfortable handling that can make daily commutes more agreeable. Unfortunately, the Mirai's availability is limited to those places with close access to hydrogen fueling stations, and the network of these facilities is sparse. As a result, this Toyota is currently offered in just two states: Hawaii and California.

<div class="landcruiser">
<img class="landcruiser" src="land cruiser.jpg" alt"toyota landcruiser" width="100%" >
<p>
The Toyota Land Cruiser is a full-size SUV that's iconic in some circles, largely because of its ability to strike a balance between plush luxury and go-anywhere ruggedness. Its imposing sheetmetal conveys heft and solidity, and this large Toyota comes with a mile-long list of standard amenities. The 2020 Toyota Land Cruiser provides forgiving ride quality on paved streets; however, it's at its best off-road, easily taking steep fire roads and rocky ravines in stride. Its most significant shortcoming is its dismal fuel economy.

<div class="Highlander">
<img class="Highlander" src="Highlander.jpg" alt"toyota Highlander" width="100%" 
<p>
The new Highlander now comes standard with a V6 engine and an 8-inch touch screen, which were extra-cost upgrades in older models. It also features Android Auto and Apple CarPlay for the first time; both are standard. The new Highlander has more standard safety features, such as road sign recognition, and available amenities that werenâ€™t offered at all in older models, like a 12.3-inch touch screen. Additionally, the 2020 Highlander boasts a larger cargo hold, as it gains 2.2 cubic feet of space behind the third row and 6.1 cubes behind the second row.
